<h2>BACKGROUND INFO</h2>
         <h4>BIOGRAPHY</h4>

        <p><strong>1994:</strong> After the untimely death of Nirvana's lead vocalist, Kurt Cobain, the two remaining members fell apart. To deal with the ensuing depression, drummer Dave Grohl founded a brand new band out of the ashes. Grohl named his new act "Foo Fighters," a term referring to the UFOs reported by jet fighters in World War II. The band started as a one-man gig in which Grohl recorded every instrument track for his first album, <i>Foo Fighters</i> (1995), but soon after, he recruited a full lineup.</p>
        <p>Since then, the band has lost and gained a few members, and has produced a present total of eight studio albums, two EPs, two compilations and one live album. The eighth studio album, <i>Sonic Highways</i>, is due to be released on November 10, 2014.</p>

<h2>MUSICAL STYLE</h2>
		<p>In its early days, Foo Fighters was comparable in style to Nirvana, Grohl's previous band. Nirvana was considered a key component of the Seattle grunge-rock scene, and their musical style partly spilled over into Grohl's new project. Grohl has acknowledged that Kurt Cobain, Nirvana's front-man, has majorly influenced his song writing.</p>
        <p>Over the years, however, the group has slowly evolved its own distinct sound. Foo Fighters are noted for their ability to faultlessly meld light melodies with their heavy choruses while implementing complex rhythms beneath. Overall, their style is an exciting combination of grunge, heavy alternative and punk, all refined and rolled into one tightly-wrapped package.</p>

<h2>WHY I LIKE THEIR MUSIC</h2>
        <p>I must have discovered Foo Fighters right around the turn of the century, when I was just starting middle school. This time marked my formative years when it came to musical taste, when alternative and punk rock quickly grew to become my favorite picks of the genre-litter. Foo Fighters were one of the first bands I started paying attention to once I really got a chance to discover radio, and since then they have continued to release exciting new music and have kept me a loyal fan for well over a decade.</p>
        <p>One thing I look for in musical artists is their ability to form their own sound while gradually evolving it over the years to keep it fresh in the ears of their listeners. Foo Fighters have done just that. From each new album to each new single, each addition to their catalogue is different than the last, while still maintaining that distinct, melodically and stylistically diverse Foo Fighters sound. They are consistent in their inconsistency, and I love it.</p>
